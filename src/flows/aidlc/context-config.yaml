        ⚠️ Project standards not found.

        The Construction Agent needs project standards to generate consistent code.
        Missing: {missing_files}

        Please run project initialization first:
        → Use Master Agent with 'project-init' skill

        Or continue without standards (code may be inconsistent).

# Note: Other agents (Master, Inception, Operations) do not require
# standards to be loaded. They will be added here when needed.
