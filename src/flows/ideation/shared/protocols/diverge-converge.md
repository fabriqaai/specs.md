# Diverge-Converge Protocol

The Osborn-Parnes dual-thinking pattern applied across the Ideation flow.

## Core Principle

Creative thinking requires two distinct modes that must be kept **strictly separate**:

1. **Divergent thinking** — Generate as many ideas as possible. Defer judgment. Quantity over quality. Wild ideas welcome.
2. **Convergent thinking** — Evaluate, filter, combine, select. Apply judgment. Quality over quantity. Practicality matters.

Mixing them kills creativity. Judging during generation produces safe, incremental ideas. Generating during evaluation produces scattered, unfocused analysis.

## Application Across Skills

### Spark = Pure Divergence

- **Mode**: Divergent ONLY
- **Judgment**: Deferred completely
- **Goal**: Maximum quantity and diversity of ideas
- **Rules**:
  - No evaluating ideas during generation
  - No "that won't work" — every idea gets recorded
  - Wild ideas encouraged — they can be tamed later
  - Build on ideas — "yes, and..." not "yes, but..."
  - When user reacts negatively to an idea, acknowledge and move on — don't defend or evaluate

### Flame = Convergence (with structured divergence)

- **Mode**: Primarily convergent, with divergent extensions
- **Judgment**: Applied through structured frameworks (Six Hats)
- **Goal**: Evaluate fairly, discover hidden value, create shortlist
- **Rules**:
  - Evaluate ALL ideas, not just favorites (hidden gems exist)
  - Use multiple perspectives (Six Hats prevents single-lens evaluation)
  - Allow divergent extension: "This idea isn't great as-is, but what if we modified..."
  - Score on multiple dimensions, not a single metric

### Forge = Alternating Diverge-Converge

- **Mode**: Rapid alternation (Disney Strategy)
- **Judgment**: Alternates between suspended (Dreamer) and applied (Realist, Critic)
- **Goal**: Develop ideas into robust, actionable concepts
- **Rules**:
  - Dreamer phase: Pure divergence — no limits, no criticism
  - Realist phase: Convergent — how would this actually work?
  - Critic phase: Evaluative — what could go wrong?
  - Each phase is strictly separated — no mixing

## The "Deferred Judgment" Contract

During divergent phases, the AI MUST:
- Record every idea, even seemingly bad ones
- Never add qualifiers like "while this might not be practical..."
- Never rank or compare ideas within a divergent phase
- Treat every idea as equally valid until convergence

During convergent phases, the AI MUST:
- Apply consistent evaluation criteria
- Not generate new ideas (unless explicitly extending)
- Acknowledge trade-offs rather than seeking a single "best"
- Present evaluation as multi-dimensional, not pass/fail

## Transition Signals

The AI should signal mode transitions clearly:

- Divergent → Convergent: "We've generated N ideas. Let's evaluate them."
- Convergent → Divergent: "This evaluation suggests a new direction. Let's explore it."
- Within Forge: "Let's dream freely first... Now let's get practical... Now let's stress-test."
