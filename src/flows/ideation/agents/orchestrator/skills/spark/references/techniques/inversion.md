# Inversion Technique

**Origin**: Charlie Munger's "invert, always invert" principle; also found in de Bono's lateral thinking and Osborn's reversal prompters.

**Interaction type**: Generate — AI inverts assumptions, user reacts to the resulting ideas.

## How It Works

1. **State the goal** clearly
2. **Invert it** — ask "how would I achieve the exact opposite?"
3. **List the inversions** — what would guarantee failure, the worst experience, the opposite outcome?
4. **Reverse each inversion** — the opposite of each failure mode is often a non-obvious success strategy

## Inversion Patterns

### Goal Inversion
- Goal: "Make onboarding fast" → Inverted: "How to make onboarding take forever?"
- Answers: No documentation, no buddy system, surprise requirements → Ideas: Pre-arrival portal, day-1 buddy auto-match, zero-surprise checklist

### User Inversion
- Design for the opposite user: experts → beginners, individuals → teams, tech-savvy → tech-averse
- Forces empathy and reveals assumptions

### Process Inversion
- Reverse the order: What if the last step came first?
- End-to-outcome: Start with the desired result and work backward
- Often reveals unnecessary steps

### Value Inversion
- What if the biggest cost became the biggest feature?
- What if the bug became the selling point?
- Turns weaknesses into differentiators

### Anti-Problem
- Instead of solving the problem, make it irrelevant
- Instead of reducing friction, make the friction delightful
- Reframe rather than fix

## AI Application Notes

When using inversion internally:
1. Pick the most interesting inversion pattern for the current topic
2. Actually go through the full inversion (state goal → invert → list failure modes → reverse)
3. The best ideas come from reversing *non-obvious* failure modes
4. Present the resulting ideas without explaining the inversion process
5. Excellent for batch #2+ when initial ideas feel too "safe"
