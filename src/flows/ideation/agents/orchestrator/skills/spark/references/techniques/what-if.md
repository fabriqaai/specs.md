# What-If Scenarios Technique

**Origin**: Assumption-challenging methodology found across creative problem solving traditions.

**Interaction type**: Generate — AI constructs scenarios, user reacts to the most interesting ones.

## How It Works

1. **Identify core assumptions** about the topic (explicit and implicit)
2. **Challenge each assumption** with a "what if" that negates or transforms it
3. **Explore the scenario** — what would the world look like if this were true?
4. **Extract ideas** from the alternate reality

## Types of What-If

### Constraint Removal
- What if money were no object?
- What if there were no technical limitations?
- What if you had unlimited time?
- What if there were no regulations?

### Constraint Inversion
- What if the user had to pay NOT to use it?
- What if it only worked for 5 minutes per day?
- What if it required 100 people to operate?

### Context Shift
- What if this existed in 1920? In 2120?
- What if this were designed for children? For astronauts? For animals?
- What if this operated underwater? In zero gravity? In complete darkness?

### Scale Shift
- What if 1 billion people used this simultaneously?
- What if it were the size of a building? A molecule?
- What if it lasted 100 years? 100 milliseconds?

### Role Reversal
- What if the customer built it and the company used it?
- What if the problem were actually the solution?
- What if success and failure metrics were swapped?

## AI Application Notes

When using what-if internally:
1. Identify 2-3 non-obvious assumptions about the topic
2. Pick the most interesting what-if type for each assumption
3. Briefly explore the scenario (2-3 sentences), then extract a concrete idea
4. Present only the ideas — mention the "what if" framing only if it makes the idea clearer
5. Best used when ideas are getting too conventional or practical
