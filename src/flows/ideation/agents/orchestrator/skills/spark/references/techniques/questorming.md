# Questorming Technique

**Origin**: Hal Gregersen's "Question Burst" methodology; also related to Osborn's principle of exploring the problem space before solving.

**Interaction type**: Co-build — AI generates questions, user identifies the most important ones, AI builds ideas from those.

## How It Works

1. **State the topic** without any solutions in mind
2. **Generate questions only** — no answers allowed during this phase
3. **Aim for 15-20 questions** in rapid succession
4. **Categorize** — which questions challenge assumptions? Which reframe the problem?
5. **Select the most provocative questions** — these become the seed for new ideas
6. **Generate ideas** from the selected questions

## Question Types

### Assumption-Challenging
- Why do we assume [X] is necessary?
- What if [commonly accepted truth] were false?
- Who said this has to be done by [conventional actor]?

### Scope-Shifting
- What if we zoom out 10x — what's the bigger problem?
- What if we zoom in 10x — what's the specific pain point?
- What would this look like from the customer's customer's perspective?

### Stakeholder Questions
- Who benefits from the current broken state?
- Who would lose if we solved this perfectly?
- Who has already solved this in a different context?

### Temporal Questions
- Why hasn't this been solved yet?
- What will make this irrelevant in 5 years?
- What had to change for this to become solvable now?

### Provocative Questions
- What's the most expensive possible solution? The cheapest?
- What would a competitor do with this opportunity?
- What would a child suggest?

## AI Application Notes

When using questorming internally:
1. Generate a burst of 8-10 questions about the topic
2. Present 3-5 of the most provocative ones to the user
3. Ask: "Which of these feels most important?" (the one elicit moment)
4. If user doesn't engage, pick the most provocative question yourself (ai_fallback)
5. Generate ideas seeded from the selected question(s)
6. Best used when the problem space feels unclear or when the user says "I'm not sure what I want"
