# Anti-Bias Reference (Spark Skill)

Quick reference for the anti-bias engine during idea generation. See `shared/protocols/anti-bias.md` for the full protocol.

## Domain Wheel (12 Sectors)

| # | Domain | Example Application |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Technology/Engineering | Systems, algorithms, automation, tools |
| 2 | Human Psychology/Behavior | Motivation, habits, cognition, emotion |
| 3 | Business/Economics | Markets, incentives, pricing, value chains |
| 4 | Nature/Biology | Ecosystems, evolution, biomimicry, growth |
| 5 | Art/Design/Aesthetics | Form, beauty, expression, experience |
| 6 | Games/Play | Competition, rules, progression, fun |
| 7 | Social/Community | Networks, culture, belonging, collaboration |
| 8 | Physical Space/Architecture | Layout, flow, wayfinding, environment |
| 9 | Time/Temporal | Timing, rhythm, duration, history, future |
| 10 | Extreme/Edge Cases | Exceptions, outliers, extremes, limits |
| 11 | Inversion/Opposite | Reversal, contradiction, opposite approach |
| 12 | Random Cross-Pollination | Unrelated connections, serendipity |

## Per-Batch Rules

- Each batch of 5 ideas MUST include 3+ different domains
- Never 2 consecutive ideas from the same domain
- Prioritize underused domains (track usage in session state)
- If user favorites cluster in one domain, deliberately diversify next batch

## Provocation Schedule

- Every 15 ideas: inject 1 deliberately absurd/provocative idea
- Every 20 ideas: shift perspective entirely

## Provocation Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Inversion | What if the opposite were true? |
| Exaggeration | What if 1000x bigger/smaller? |
| Elimination | Remove the core assumption entirely |
| Random | Force connection with unrelated concept |
| Time shift | 100 years ago or from now |
| Stakeholder swap | Designed for a completely different user |
