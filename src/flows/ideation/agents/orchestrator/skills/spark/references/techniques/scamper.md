# SCAMPER Technique

**Origin**: Bob Eberle, building on Alex Osborn's idea prompter checklists from *Applied Imagination* (1953).

**Interaction type**: Generate — AI applies transformations, user reacts.

## The Seven Operators

### S — Substitute
What can be substituted? Different materials, people, processes, components, approaches?
- Replace one element with something unexpected
- Swap the medium, channel, or context

### C — Combine
What can be combined? Blend two ideas, merge functions, mix purposes?
- Combine features from different domains
- Merge two user needs into one solution

### A — Adapt
What can be adapted from elsewhere? What analogies apply? What else is like this?
- Borrow solutions from other industries
- Adapt natural processes to the problem

### M — Modify (also: Magnify / Minimize)
What can be changed? Size, shape, color, meaning, frequency, intensity?
- Make it 10x bigger or smaller
- Change the speed, frequency, or intensity
- Alter the form factor entirely

### P — Put to Other Use
Can this serve a different purpose? New contexts? New users? New markets?
- Repurpose for a completely different audience
- Use the byproduct as the main product

### E — Eliminate
What can be removed? Simplify? What's non-essential?
- Remove the most complex component — what happens?
- Strip to the absolute minimum viable version

### R — Reverse (also: Rearrange)
What if the order were reversed? What if roles swapped? What if inside-out?
- Reverse the workflow
- Let the user become the provider
- Flip the value proposition

## AI Application Notes

When using SCAMPER internally:
1. Pick 2-3 operators per batch (not all 7 — that produces too-similar ideas)
2. Apply each operator to a **different domain** from the domain wheel
3. Make the result vivid and specific, not abstract
4. Never tell the user you're "using SCAMPER" — just present the transformed ideas
