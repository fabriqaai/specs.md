# Cross-Domain Analogy Technique

**Origin**: Synectics (William Gordon, 1961); also central to Osborn's *Applied Imagination* approach of "What else is like this?"

**Interaction type**: Generate — AI finds analogous problems in distant domains and adapts solutions.

## How It Works

1. **Abstract the problem** — strip away domain-specific details to find the core challenge
2. **Find analogous problems** in distant domains that share the same core challenge
3. **Study how those domains solve it** — what mechanisms, patterns, or principles do they use?
4. **Transfer the solution** back to the original domain, adapting as needed

## Analogy Sources

### Nature (Biomimicry)
- How does nature solve similar problems?
- Velcro from burrs, bullet trains from kingfisher beaks, self-healing materials from skin
- Best for: structural, efficiency, and resilience problems

### Games & Sports
- How do games create engagement, manage competition, handle fairness?
- Matchmaking, progression systems, handicaps, spectator modes
- Best for: engagement, fairness, and motivation problems

### Architecture & Urban Planning
- How do cities manage flow, density, growth, safety?
- Zoning, traffic patterns, public spaces, wayfinding
- Best for: scale, navigation, and organization problems

### Music & Performance
- How do musicians create tension, resolution, improvisation, collaboration?
- Call-and-response, crescendo, variations on a theme
- Best for: experience design, pacing, and collaboration problems

### History & Civilization
- How did past civilizations solve similar problems?
- Trade routes, governance, knowledge preservation, cultural transmission
- Best for: communication, governance, and knowledge problems

### Medicine & Biology
- How does the body handle similar challenges?
- Immune system (threats), nervous system (signals), circulatory system (distribution)
- Best for: security, communication, and distribution problems

## AI Application Notes

When using analogy internally:
1. Abstract the topic to its core challenge (e.g., "reduce onboarding time" → "accelerate knowledge transfer")
2. Pick 2-3 distant domains from the list above
3. Find genuine analogies (not surface-level similarities)
4. The transfer should produce ideas the user wouldn't have thought of
5. Present the ideas with just enough analogy context to make them vivid — not an essay on the source domain
