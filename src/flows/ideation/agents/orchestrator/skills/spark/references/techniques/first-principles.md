# First Principles Technique

**Origin**: Aristotelian reasoning, popularized in innovation context by Elon Musk and others. Distinct from reasoning by analogy.

**Interaction type**: Generate — AI decomposes to fundamentals, then rebuilds novel solutions.

## How It Works

1. **Identify the conventional approach** — how is this problem normally solved?
2. **List all assumptions** embedded in the conventional approach
3. **Challenge each assumption** — is it a physical law, or just a convention?
4. **Decompose to fundamentals** — what are the irreducible truths?
5. **Rebuild from fundamentals** — without the conventional assumptions, what new solutions emerge?

## Decomposition Framework

### Layer 1: Surface (What people do)
- Current behaviors, products, services
- "Everyone does it this way because..."

### Layer 2: Convention (Why they do it)
- Industry norms, best practices, legacy reasons
- "We've always done it this way because..."

### Layer 3: Constraints (Real vs. assumed)
- Physical laws, regulations, actual technical limits
- vs. "We assumed this was a constraint but it's actually a choice"

### Layer 4: Fundamentals (Irreducible truths)
- What must be true regardless of implementation?
- What does the user actually need (not what they're used to)?
- What are the physics/economics that can't be changed?

## Example

**Topic**: Improving conference networking

- **Conventional**: Name badges, cocktail hours, speed networking sessions
- **Assumption challenged**: "People need to be in the same room to network"
- **Assumption challenged**: "Networking means meeting new people"
- **Fundamental**: People need to find others with complementary interests/needs
- **Rebuilt**: A system that matches attendees by complementary gaps (what you need + what you offer) and creates micro-contexts for connection, regardless of physical proximity

## AI Application Notes

When using first-principles internally:
1. Don't just list the fundamentals — actually strip away conventions and rebuild
2. The power is in identifying which "constraints" are actually conventions
3. Best used when ideas feel incremental — first-principles thinking produces category-shifting ideas
4. Present the rebuilt ideas as concrete concepts, not philosophical observations
5. Can combine with other techniques: first-principles decomposition → analogy transfer → SCAMPER refinement
