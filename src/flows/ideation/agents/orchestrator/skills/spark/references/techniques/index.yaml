# Spark Technique Index
# Each technique declares its natural interaction type and AI behavior.
# The AI selects techniques internally — never expose technique names to the user.

    best_for: "Reframing the problem space through better questions"
    asks:
      - trigger: "after generating question batch"
        question: "Which of these questions feels most important to you?"
    ai_fallback: "AI selects the most provocative question and generates ideas from it"
    reference: techniques/questorming.md

# Technique Selection Strategy
# The AI selects techniques based on:
# 1. Which domains are underexplored (anti-bias engine)
# 2. User energy/engagement level
# 3. Which techniques haven't been used recently
# 4. Whether the user wants "wilder" (→ inversion, random-word) or "practical" (→ first-principles, analogy)
