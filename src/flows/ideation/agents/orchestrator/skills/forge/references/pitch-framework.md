# Pitch Framework

Structures for presenting concepts clearly and persuasively. Used when generating Concept Briefs.

## Concept Brief Structure

Every Concept Brief follows this structure:

### 1. One-Liner
A single sentence that captures the essence. If you can't say it in one sentence, the concept isn't clear enough.

**Formula**: [Action] + [for whom] + [unique mechanism] + [key benefit]

**Examples**:
- "A quest-based onboarding system that turns new hire setup into a game, cutting time-to-productivity by 60%."
- "A reverse mentoring platform where junior employees teach executives about emerging tech, building cross-generational understanding."

### 2. Problem
What pain exists today? Be specific and vivid.

**Formula**: [Who] + [experiences what pain] + [how often/severely] + [what it costs them]

### 3. Concept
How does this solve the problem? What's the mechanism?

**Elements**:
- Core mechanism (how it works)
- Key differentiator (why this approach vs. others)
- User experience (what does the user see/feel/do?)

### 4. Why It Works
What makes this concept compelling? Why will it succeed?

**Types of evidence**:
- Analogies that have worked elsewhere
- Research or data that supports the approach
- First-principles reasoning
- User psychology insights

### 5. Risks & Mitigations
What could go wrong, and what's the plan?

**Format per risk**:
- **Risk**: {what could go wrong}
- **Likelihood**: Low / Medium / High
- **Impact**: Low / Medium / High
- **Mitigation**: {specific action to prevent or address}

### 6. Next Steps
What would you do first to move this forward?

**Good next steps are**:
- Specific (not "do more research")
- Actionable (can be started this week)
- Time-bounded (has a deadline or milestone)
- Testable (you'll know if it worked)

## Pitch Principles

### Specificity Over Abstraction
- Bad: "Leverage gamification to improve engagement"
- Good: "A quest system where each completed onboarding task unlocks a new tool, with a leaderboard showing progress vs. cohort average"

### Show, Don't Categorize
- Bad: "This is a B2B SaaS solution for the enterprise market"
- Good: "When a new VP of Engineering joins, they open their laptop and see a personalized roadmap..."

### One Problem, One Solution
Each concept brief tackles one clear problem. If there are multiple problems, make multiple briefs.

### The "Tell a Friend" Test
The one-liner should be something someone would actually say to a colleague: "Hey, have you heard about this thing that [one-liner]?"
