# Six Thinking Hats Method

**Origin**: Edward de Bono, *Six Thinking Hats* (1985). Parallel thinking paradigm that separates ego from exploration.

## Core Concept

Instead of arguing different positions, everyone (or the AI) wears the same "hat" at the same time, exploring one perspective fully before moving to the next. This prevents:
- **Ego defense** — ideas aren't "yours" or "mine"
- **Argument** — you're not debating, you're exploring perspectives
- **Incomplete analysis** — each hat forces a perspective that might be skipped

## The Six Hats

### White Hat — Facts & Data
- What do we know for certain?
- What data exists? What's missing?
- No interpretation or opinion — just facts
- **AI application**: State what's objectively true about the idea, what evidence supports it, what data would be needed

### Red Hat — Feelings & Intuition
- What's the gut reaction?
- Emotions, hunches, instincts — no justification needed
- **AI application**: This is the ONE hat where user input is critical. AI should ask: "What's your gut feeling?" If user defers, AI infers from engagement patterns.

### Black Hat — Risks & Caution
- What could go wrong?
- Where are the dangers, weaknesses, pitfalls?
- Devil's advocate perspective
- **AI application**: Be genuinely critical — not token concerns. Identify real risks: market, technical, adoption, unintended consequences.

### Yellow Hat — Benefits & Optimism
- What's the best case scenario?
- Why could this work? What's the upside?
- Look for value even in seemingly weak ideas
- **AI application**: Find genuine strengths. For weak ideas, ask: "What kernel of value exists here?"

### Green Hat — Creative Extensions
- How could this be improved, combined, extended?
- New alternatives, modifications, provocations
- This is the divergent hat within convergence
- **AI application**: Suggest creative modifications, combinations with other ideas, unexpected extensions

### Blue Hat — Process & Planning
- What would implementation look like?
- What steps are needed? What's the timeline?
- Meta-thinking about the idea
- **AI application**: Sketch the implementation path, key decisions, resources needed

## Sequencing for Ideation Flow

### Rapid Evaluation Sequence (Flame default)
```
White → Yellow → Black → Green → Blue
```
Red Hat is handled separately (requires user input).

**Rationale**:
- Start with facts (ground the discussion)
- Benefits before risks (prevents premature dismissal)
- Creative extensions after critique (rescue and improve)
- Process last (only relevant for shortlisted ideas)

### Full Sequence (for top shortlisted ideas)
```
Blue → White → Red → Yellow → Black → Green → Blue
```
Starting and ending with Blue provides process framing.

## AI Execution Notes

1. **Keep each hat brief** — 1-2 sentences per hat for rapid analysis, 1 paragraph for deep analysis
2. **Wear one hat at a time** — don't mix perspectives within a hat section
3. **Yellow before Black** — always find value before finding faults
4. **Green is where extension happens** — this is where "this idea could be better if..." lives
5. **Red Hat requires genuine pause** — don't rush past feelings to get to logic
