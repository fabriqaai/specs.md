## Source 3: "Six Thinking Hats" — Edward de Bono (1985)

The full book, providing a complete parallel thinking methodology.

### The Six Hats

| Hat | Mode | Function |
|-----|------|----------|
| **White** | Facts & Information | Neutral data only. No opinions. Two tiers: verified facts vs. believed facts. |
| **Red** | Emotions & Intuition | Feelings without justification. Hunches, gut reactions, aesthetic preferences. |
| **Black** | Caution & Critical | Logical-negative judgment with reasons. Risks, dangers, what won't work. NOT emotional negativity. |
| **Yellow** | Positive & Constructive | Deliberate search for benefits. Reasoned optimism. Proposals and suggestions. |
| **Green** | Creativity & Lateral | New ideas, provocations ("po"), random word technique, movement language, creative pause. |
| **Blue** | Process Control | Meta-thinking. Orchestrates sequence, defines focus, synthesizes conclusions. |

### Core Methodology — "Cartographic Thinking"

1. Replace adversarial debate with parallel map-making
2. Each hat is used one at a time (separation of thinking modes)
3. Colors protect ego — "My Black Hat says..." not "I'm being negative"
4. Yellow Hat ALWAYS before Black Hat for new ideas
5. Red Hat requires NO justification; Black Hat ALWAYS requires reasons

### Session Structure (Formal Program)

Red → White → Yellow → Green → Blue interval → Yellow+Green → Black selective → Yellow+Green (overcome obstacles) → Black reinspection → Blue panorama → Red → Election → Blue final

### Key Techniques

- **PMI** (Plus/Minus/Interesting)
- **Provocative Operation (Po)** — deliberately absurd statements as stepping stones
- **Random Word** — juxtapose random noun with problem
- **Movement Language** — "Where does this lead?" replaces "Is this right?"
- **Inversion** — take normal process and reverse it
- **Creative Pause** — stop when everything works to ask "Is there an alternative?"
- **Best-Case Analysis** — start speculative thinking with best possible outcome

### Five Values of the Method

1. **Role-playing (ego protection)**: Hats define roles that free the ego from defensive thinking
2. **Attention direction**: Systematic way to direct attention to one aspect at a time
3. **Convenience**: Color-coded system provides neutral, non-threatening language
4. **Possible neurochemical basis**: Different thinking modes may correspond to different brain chemistry
5. **Rules of the game**: People are good at learning game rules; hats establish clear rules for thinking

**Editions:**
- 1st edition: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1953
- Revised edition: Scribner, 1957
- 3rd edition: C. Scribner, 1963
- French translation: *L'Imagination constructive*, Dunod, 1959
- Chinese translation: Taipei, 1965

### Osborn's Four Rules of Brainstorming

1. **Defer judgment** — criticism withheld until later
2. **Freewheel** — wilder ideas are better
3. **Go for quantity** — more ideas = more winners
4. **Combine and improve** — build on others' ideas

### Two-Mind Model

- **Judicial mind**: analyzes, compares, selects
- **Creative mind**: visualizes, foresees, generates
- Early judgment suppresses creativity; groups produce 10x more ideas when deferring judgment

### Creative Process Stages

Orientation → Preparation → Analysis → Ideation → Incubation → Synthesis

### Idea Prompter Checklist (became SCAMPER)

Adapt? Modify? Magnify? Minify? Substitute? Rearrange? Reverse? Combine?

### Operational Specs

- Group size: 5-12 people
- Session duration: 30-45 minutes
- Environment: bright rooms, pencils/pads, stenographic recording
- Hierarchy: don't mix organizational levels
- Pre-session: participants must understand the problem + do individual pre-ideation
- Post-session: individual ideation continues afterward

### BBDO Results (by 1956)

47 panels, 401 sessions, 34,000 ideas generated, 2,000 deemed superior. ~10% of ideas prove usable.

### Osborn-Parnes CPS Model (6 Stages)

| Stage | Phase | Thinking |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Mess/Objective Finding | **Clarify** | Divergent → Convergent |
| 2. Fact-Finding | **Clarify** | Divergent → Convergent |
| 3. Problem-Finding | **Clarify** | Divergent → Convergent |
| 4. Idea-Finding | **Ideate** | Divergent → Convergent |
| 5. Solution-Finding | **Develop** | Divergent → Convergent |
| 6. Action-Finding | **Implement** | Divergent → Convergent |

Each stage alternates between divergent (generate many) and convergent (select best) thinking.

### Historical Evolution

- 1942: Osborn publishes "How to Think Up" (first mention)
- 1953: "Applied Imagination" formalizes brainstorming
- 1958: Yale study challenges group brainstorming (but deviated from Osborn's specs)
- Two schools diverge: Yale (individual, quality focus) vs. Osborn faithful (group, quantity focus)
- IDEO: Most faithful modern adoption — daily 90-min sessions, 7 rules
- Isaksen (1998): Brainstorming is "the most researched yet least understood" creative technique

## Source 5: "Brainstorming" — Wikipedia (Full Article, 12 pages)

The comprehensive Wikipedia article on brainstorming, covering history, methodology, variations, research, and challenges.

### Osborn's Original Method (Detailed)

**Two founding principles:** Defer judgment + Reach for quantity

**Four rules designed to:**
- Reduce social inhibitions among group members
- Stimulate idea generation
- Increase overall creativity of the group

**Operational constraints:**
- Must address a single specific question (multi-question sessions are inefficient)
- Problem must require idea generation, not analytical judgment
- Groups of ~12, mixing experts and novices
- Anonymous idea writing → facilitator collects → group votes (distillation)
- Top ideas sent to subgroups for further brainstorming
- Facilitator must be trained; group needs practice sessions

### Brainstorming Variations

| Variation | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Nominal Group Technique** | Write individually → share round-robin → discuss → vote/rank |
| **Group Passing** | Write idea, pass paper in circle, each person adds to it |
| **Idea Book** | Routing slip on book, each person adds ideas over time, then read-out meeting |
| **Team Idea Mapping** | Individual brainstorm → merge onto one large idea map → prioritize |
| **Directed Brainstorming** | Known criteria constrain ideation; swap papers, improve ideas for 3+ rounds. Triples productivity over electronic brainstorming |
| **Guided Brainstorming** | Adopt different mindsets for set periods, contribute to central mind map |
| **Individual Brainstorming** | Solo: free writing, free speaking, word association, mind mapping. Shown to be **superior** to traditional group brainstorming |
| **Question Brainstorming** | Brainstorm the questions, not answers. Creates perspectives. Also called "questorming" |
| **Electronic Brainstorming (EBS)** | Computer-mediated, simultaneous anonymous input, reduces production blocking and evaluation apprehension |

### Research: Challenges to Group Brainstorming

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Production Blocking** | Only one person speaks at a time → others forget ideas or lose train of thought |
| **Collaborative Fixation** | Group ideas reduce domain exploration; members conform to each other's themes |
| **Evaluation Apprehension** | Fear of judgment, especially with authority figures present. High social anxiety = lower output |
| **Free-writing Effect** | Individuals produce fewer ideas when told output will be judged as a group |
| **Social Matching** | Participants adjust their rate to match group average (usually down) |
| **Illusion of Group Productivity** | Members overestimate group output because: (1) claim others' ideas as own, (2) compare to low performers, (3) communal process masks individual failure |

**Key finding (Diehl & Stroebe, 22-study review):** Groups brainstorming together produce **fewer** ideas than individuals working separately.

### Methods to Improve Sessions

1. Avoid face-to-face groups (use brainwriting, electronic methods)
2. Stick to rules — give feedback on violations
3. Pay attention to everyone's ideas (list them, repeat them)
4. Combine individual and group approaches
5. Take breaks — allow silence for thinking
6. Don't rush — more time = higher quality
7. Stay persistent even when productivity dips
8. Use a skilled facilitator

### Alternatives When Brainstorming Fails

| Alternative | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Buzzgroups** | Subgroups generate ideas, then rejoin main group |
| **Bug List** | Write down irritations/problems, then solve each |
| **Stepladder** | New members state ideas before hearing group position |
| **Synectics** | Leader uses analogies, metaphors, fantasy |
| **TRIZ** | Engineering-focused: problem analysis → resource review → goal setting → prior approaches |

### Incentives Research

- **Condition I** (flat fee): baseline
- **Condition II** (paid per unique idea): outperformed I
- **Condition III** (paid by idea impact on group): outperformed II
- Conclusion: impact-based compensation produces highest quality and effort

## Cross-Resource Synthesis

### Convergent Themes Across All Five Sources

1. **Separate generation from evaluation** — Osborn's deferred judgment, De Bono's hat separation, every toolkit reinforces this
2. **Quantity first** — Osborn's "quantity breeds quality", all sources agree
3. **Structured process beats unstructured** — CPS stages, Hat sequences, technique toolkits all add structure
4. **Multiple modes of thinking** — De Bono's 6 modes, Osborn's judicial/creative split, Disney's Dreamer/Realist/Critic
5. **Build on others' ideas** — Osborn's Rule 4, brainwriting, nominal group technique
6. **Problem definition matters as much as ideation** — 5 Whys, Fishbone, NESTA, CPS Stages 1-3
