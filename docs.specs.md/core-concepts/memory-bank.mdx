## What is the Memory Bank?

The **Memory Bank** is a file-based storage system for all project artifacts. It maintains context across agent sessions and provides traceability between artifacts.

<Info>
  Unlike traditional documentation that gets stale, the Memory Bank is actively used by agents. It's the source of truth that agents read and write.

## Why Memory Bank?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Context Persistence" icon="database">
    Agents reload context from Memory Bank each session. No more lost knowledge.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Traceability" icon="link">
    Every artifact links to its source. Requirements → Design → Code → Tests.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Human Readable" icon="file-lines">
    All files are Markdown. Review, edit, and version control with Git.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Accessible" icon="robot">
    Structured format that agents can parse and update.

## Structure

After project initialization:

```
memory-bank/
├── intents/                   # Your captured intents
│   └── {intent-name}/
│       ├── requirements.md
│       ├── system-context.md
│       └── units/
│           └── {unit-name}/
│               ├── unit-brief.md
│               ├── stories/
│               └── bolts/
├── bolts/                     # Bolt execution records
│   └── {bolt-id}/
│       ├── domain-model.md
│       ├── technical-design.md
│       └── implementation/
├── standards/                 # Project standards
│   ├── tech-stack.md
│   ├── coding-standards.md
│   ├── architecture.md
│   └── ux-guide.md
└── operations/                # Deployment context

    └── runbooks/
```

## Artifact Types

### Standards

Project-wide decisions that inform AI code generation:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tech-stack.md` | Languages, frameworks, databases |
| `coding-standards.md` | Formatting, naming, patterns |
| `architecture.md` | System architecture decisions |
| `ux-guide.md` | Design system, styling |
| `api-conventions.md` | API style, versioning |

### Intent Artifacts

Captured requirements and context:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `requirements.md` | User stories, acceptance criteria, NFRs |
| `system-context.md` | Boundaries, interfaces, constraints |
| `units.md` | Unit decomposition overview |

### Unit Artifacts

Work breakdown within an intent:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `unit-brief.md` | Scope, interfaces, dependencies |
| `stories/*.md` | Individual user stories |
| `bolts/*/` | Bolt execution records |

### Bolt Artifacts

Implementation records:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `domain-model.md` | DDD artifacts |
| `technical-design.md` | Architecture decisions |
| `adr-*.md` | Architectural Decision Records |
| `implementation/` | Generated code |
| `tests/` | Test files |

## Traceability

Artifacts link to each other using references:

```markdown
# Technical Design: User Registration

## Source
- Intent: user-authentication
- Unit: user-registration  
- Story: US-001

## Related ADRs
- [ADR-001: Password Hashing Algorithm](./adr-001.md)

## Implementation
- [src/auth/registration.ts](../../src/auth/registration.ts)
```

## Agent Interaction

Agents read and write to the Memory Bank:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Context Loading">
    Agent reads relevant artifacts at session start
  </Step>
  <Step title="Work Execution">
    Agent generates new artifacts during work
  </Step>
  <Step title="Artifact Storage">
    Agent writes artifacts to Memory Bank
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference Linking">
    Agent updates cross-references
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Version Control

The Memory Bank is designed for Git:

```bash
# Track all artifacts
git add memory-bank/

# Meaningful commit messages
git commit -m "feat(auth): Complete user registration bolt"

# Review changes in PRs
git diff memory-bank/intents/auth/
```

<Warning>
  Commit Memory Bank changes along with code changes. This maintains the connection between decisions and implementation.
</Warning>

## Schema

The Memory Bank follows a schema defined in `.specsmd/aidlc/memory-bank.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
structure:
  intents:
    pattern: "{intent-name}/"
    required:
      - requirements.md
      - system-context.md
    optional:
      - units/
  standards:
    required:
      - tech-stack.md
      - coding-standards.md
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Artifacts Current">
    Update artifacts when decisions change. Stale documentation is worse than no documentation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Consistent Formatting">
    Follow the templates. Consistent structure helps agents parse content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Link Generously">
    Cross-reference related artifacts. Traceability prevents knowledge silos.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Version with Code">
    Commit Memory Bank changes with related code. They belong together.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
