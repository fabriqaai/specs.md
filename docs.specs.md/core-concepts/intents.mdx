## What is an Intent?

An **Intent** is a high-level statement of purpose that encapsulates what needs to be achieved - whether a business goal, feature, or technical outcome. It serves as the starting point for AI-driven decomposition.

<Info>
  Think of an Intent as the answer to "What do we want to build?" without getting into the details of "How do we build it?"
</Info>

## Examples of Intents

Good intents are clear, outcome-focused, and appropriately scoped:

## Intent Structure

When captured, an Intent becomes a directory in your Memory Bank:

```
memory-bank/intents/{intent-name}/
├── requirements.md      # User stories, acceptance criteria, NFRs
├── system-context.md    # Boundaries, interfaces, constraints
└── units/               # Decomposed units
    ├── {unit-1}/
    └── {unit-2}/
```

## Creating an Intent

Use the Inception Agent to create intents:

```bash
/specsmd-inception-agent intent-create
```

The agent will guide you through:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe Your Goal">
    Explain what you want to achieve in plain language
  </Step>
  <Step title="Answer Clarifying Questions">
    The AI asks questions to minimize ambiguity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Requirements">
    Validate the generated user stories and NFRs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Context">
    Establish system boundaries and constraints
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Intent vs Epic

| Aspect | Agile Epic | AI-DLC Intent |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Definition** | Large body of work | Statement of purpose |
| **Decomposition** | Manual by team | AI-powered |
| **Output** | User stories | Units with stories |
| **Context** | Lost over time | Persisted in Memory Bank |

## Requirements Document

The `requirements.md` file contains:

```markdown
# Intent: User Authentication System

## User Stories

### US-001: User Registration
As a new user, I want to register with email and password
so that I can create an account.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Email validation
- [ ] Password strength requirements
- [ ] Confirmation email sent

### US-002: User Login
...

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Security
- Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- Rate limiting on login attempts

### NFR-002: Performance
- Login response time < 500ms
- Support 1000 concurrent users
```

## System Context

The `system-context.md` defines boundaries:

```markdown
# System Context: User Authentication

## In Scope
- User registration and login
- Password reset flow
- Session management

## Out of Scope
- Social login (OAuth) - future intent
- Multi-factor authentication - future intent

## Interfaces
- REST API for frontend
- Database for user storage
- Email service for notifications

## Constraints
- Must use existing PostgreSQL database
- Must integrate with current session store
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Intents Focused">
    One intent should represent one cohesive goal. If you find yourself saying "and also...", consider splitting into multiple intents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be Outcome-Oriented">
    Focus on what users will be able to do, not on technical implementation details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include Context">
    Provide relevant business context, constraints, and dependencies upfront.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Iterate on Requirements">
    Requirements will evolve. Use the agent to refine and clarify as you learn more.
