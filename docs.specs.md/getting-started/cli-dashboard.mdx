description: Live terminal dashboard for tracking development progress across all specsmd flows
---

## Overview

The CLI Dashboard is an interactive terminal UI for monitoring your development progress in real-time. It works with all three flows (FIRE, AI-DLC, Simple) and provides live updates as your project state changes.

<Info>
  The CLI Dashboard is the terminal counterpart to the [IDE Extension](/getting-started/ide-extension). Use it when working with terminal-based AI tools like Claude Code or OpenAI Codex.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx specsmd@latest dashboard
```

The dashboard auto-detects your flow and starts watching for changes. Press `q` to quit.

## Tabs

The dashboard has five tabs, switched with number keys `1`–`5`:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Active Items (1)">
    Shows currently active runs (FIRE), bolts (AI-DLC), or specs (Simple) in the selected worktree. Includes a split preview pane for inspecting files and an "other worktrees" section showing activity across branches.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intents (2)">
    Lists all intents in your project. Toggle between pending (`n`) and completed (`x`) intents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completed (3)">
    Historical view of finished runs, bolts, or specs with intent filtering.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Standards & Health (4)">
    Project standards files (constitution, tech-stack, coding-standards), progress stats, warnings, and error details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Git Changes (5)">
    Git status with staged, unstaged, untracked, and conflicted files. Select a file to preview its diff in the split pane. Shows branch tracking info with ahead/behind counts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Git Worktree Support

The dashboard auto-discovers git worktrees and shows activity across branches.

- **Worktree switcher** — press `b` on the Active tab to switch between worktrees
- **Cross-worktree view** — the "Other worktrees" section shows active runs/bolts in other branches
- **Auto-selection** — picks the current worktree by default, falling back to main

## CLI Options

```bash
npx specsmd@latest dashboard [options]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--flow <flow>` | auto-detect | Flow to inspect: `fire`, `aidlc`, or `simple` |
| `--path <dir>` | current directory | Workspace path |
| `--worktree <name>` | auto-select | Initial worktree (branch name, id, or path) |
| `--refresh-ms <n>` | `1000` | File watch interval in ms (200–5000) |
| `--no-watch` | `false` | Render once and exit (non-interactive) |

### Examples

```bash
# Auto-detect flow, live watch
npx specsmd@latest dashboard

# Specific flow
npx specsmd@latest dashboard --flow fire
