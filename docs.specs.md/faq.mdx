## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is specs.md?">
    specs.md is an implementation of the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) methodology. It provides markdown-based agents that work with your favorite AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) to guide software development from requirements through deployment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is AI-DLC?">
    AI-DLC is a software development methodology developed by AWS where AI drives the conversation and humans validate. Unlike traditional Agile with week-long sprints, AI-DLC operates in "Bolts" - rapid iterations measured in hours or days.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What AI coding tools are supported?">
    specs.md supports:
    - **Claude Code** - Full support with slash commands
    - **Cursor** - Full support with rules
    - **GitHub Copilot** - Full support with agents
    - **Google Antigravity** - Full support with agents
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is specs.md free?">
    Yes, specs.md is open source under the MIT license. You can use it freely in personal and commercial projects.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I install specs.md?">
    ```bash
    npx specsmd@latest install
    ```
    
    The installer automatically detects your AI coding tools and sets up the appropriate agents.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I install globally with npm?">
    No. Always use `npx specsmd@latest install` to ensure you get the latest version. Global installation may result in using an outdated version.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What gets installed?">
    specs.md creates a `.specsmd/` directory with:
    - Agent definitions
    - Skills and capabilities
    - Templates for artifacts
    - Memory bank schema
    
    It also creates tool-specific files (e.g., `.claude/commands/` for Claude Code).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agents don't seem to remember previous context?">
    Each agent invocation starts fresh. Agents read context from the Memory Bank at startup. 
    
    **Solution**: Ensure artifacts are saved after each step. The Memory Bank is how context persists between sessions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I reset project state?">
    To reset all artifacts, clear the `memory-bank/` directory:
    ```bash
    rm -rf memory-bank/
    ```
    
    To remove specs.md entirely:
    ```bash
    rm -rf .specsmd/
    rm -rf .claude/commands/specsmd-*  # For Claude Code
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use specs.md with existing Agile workflows?">
    AI-DLC is designed as a reimagination of development methodology, not a retrofit. However, familiar concepts (user stories, acceptance criteria) are retained to ease transition.
    
    You can use specs.md alongside existing Agile processes, treating Intents as Epics and Bolts as focused work items within sprints.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What project types is specs.md suited for?">
    specs.md is designed for building complex systems that demand:
    - Architectural complexity
    - Trade-off management
    - Scalability considerations
    
    Simpler systems may be better suited for low-code/no-code approaches or direct AI-assisted coding without the full methodology.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Methodology

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Intents, Units, and Bolts?">
    - **Intent**: High-level goal ("Build user authentication")
    - **Unit**: Cohesive work element derived from Intent ("User Registration")
    - **Bolt**: Smallest iteration, hours to days ("Registration Domain Model")

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are stage gates?">
    Stage gates are human validation points within a bolt. You must approve each stage before proceeding to the next:
    
    1. Domain Model → **GATE** → Technical Design → **GATE** → etc.
    
    This catches errors early before they cascade downstream.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What bolt types are available?">
    | Type | Use Case |
    |------|----------|
    | **DDD Construction** | Complex business logic |
    | **TDD Construction** | Well-defined interfaces |
    | **BDD Construction** | User-facing features |
    | **Spike** | Research and exploration |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the Memory Bank?">
    The Memory Bank is a file-based storage system for all project artifacts. It maintains context across agent sessions and provides traceability between requirements, designs, code, and tests.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent commands not recognized">
    Ensure specs.md is installed correctly:
    ```bash
    ls .specsmd/aidlc/agents/
    ```
    
    If the directory is empty or missing, reinstall:
    ```bash
    npx specsmd@latest install
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory Bank artifacts missing">
    Check if the memory-bank directory exists:
    ```bash
    ls memory-bank/
    ```
    
    If missing, run project initialization:
    ```bash
    /specsmd-master-agent
    > project-init
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standards not being followed in generated code">
    Ensure standards are defined in `memory-bank/standards/`:
    - `tech-stack.md`
    - `coding-standards.md`
    - `architecture.md`
    
    If missing or incomplete, use the Master Agent to define them:
    ```bash
    /specsmd-master-agent
    > project-init
    ```
  </Accordion>
