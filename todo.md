## Research/Explore Flow

Create a research agent or explore flow that generates exploration outputs consumable by all three AI-DLC phases (Inception, Construction, Operations).

**Use Cases:**
- Learning new protocols (Agentic Commerce Protocol, Agentic Client Protocol)
- Exploring unfamiliar tech stacks (Electron apps, new frameworks)
- Deep-diving into documentation and best practices

**Workflow:**
- Extended thinking for synthesis and analysis
- Web search for current information
- Report generation as structured output

**Output:**
- Exploration reports that become inputs for AI-DLC flows
- Could generate ad-hoc skills (similar to Claude Code frontend-design skill pattern)
- Knowledge artifacts stored in memory-bank for reuse

**Idea:** System creates skills on-the-fly based on research, so domain knowledge persists and can be invoked later.
